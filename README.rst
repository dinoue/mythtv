About
-----

This is Japanese ISDB extension variant fork of MythTV (31).

This still includes codes written by anonymous a.k.a 名無しさん
a lot. So, this still be unofficial.
	
This is only for Japanese variant of ISDB, not for another countries.
	
Some Japanese letters are hardcoded within libraries (mostly for EIT).
   
Status
-----
	  
 - Mostly works for Terrestrial, ISDB-T (a.k.a "地デジ").
		
 - Not checked for Satellite, ISDB-S (a.k.a BS and CS 衛星放送).
		  
 - Deb packages are buildable (from deb-multimedia.org ).
			
Please help me
